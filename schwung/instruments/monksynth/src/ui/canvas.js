 * MonkSynth — all three module-supplied draw surfaces, and the twelve faces
 * they share.
 *
 *   drawCell  "custom:monkmouth" that character's mouth, in the Vowel cell
 *   vowel_card                    the face + vowel name, floating on a turn
 *   draw                          the fullscreen face, and the character picker
 *
 * ONE FILE ON PURPOSE. `card_script` and `canvas_script` are both resolved by
 * loading a path and picking a name off globalThis, so `canvas.js#vowel_card`
 * and `canvas.js` reach the same file — and they must, because all four
 * surfaces draw the same twelve faces. Splitting them would mean two copies of
 * FACES, which is the one thing worth avoiding here. (The usual advice to keep
 * a card file small applies when the card would drag an unrelated editor in
 * with it; here the shared table IS what the card needs.)
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE ART IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
 *
 * The iOS characters are full-colour UIBezierPath drawings with clip masks,
 * alpha and HSB-derived tones. None of that survives a 128x64 1-bit panel, so
 * the SILHOUETTES here are re-authored rather than translated.
 *
 * What IS ported verbatim is the RIG — every number below (mouth anchors,
 * mouthCentre, mouthBoxFraction, eye positions, head centre and radius, prop
 * geometry) is lifted from the matching AU/UI/*Character.swift, because that
 * art is already authored in a unit square and a unit square is exactly what
 * this contract wants. So the mouths move the way MonkSynth's mouths move,
 * which is the part a player would notice.
 *
 * THE FRAME IS NOT THE SCREEN. (0,0) is the top-left of whatever box we were
 * handed and ctx.width/ctx.height are its size — a 17x15 knob cell, a 104x46
 * card, or the whole panel. Nothing here may name an absolute coordinate.
 * Everything goes through `unit()` below.
 *
 * NO READS. There is no getParam on drawCell, draw or tick. Values arrive as
 * arguments, or are cached by onOpen/onMidi, which are events rather than
 * frames.
 */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ helpers */

/*
 * A unit-square mapper over a sub-rectangle of the frame.
 *
 * `crop` is the region of the character's own unit square we want to see,
 * as [x0, y0, x1, y1]. The cell surfaces crop to the head; the big surfaces
 * show more of the body. The crop is fitted into the frame WITHOUT stretching
 * — a squashed face reads as a different character — so the shorter axis wins
 * and the result is centred.
 */
/*
 * ONE DRAWING VOCABULARY OVER TWO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.
 *
 * A widget/card frameCtx carries fillRect, print, textWidth, setPixel, line,
 * fillCircle, drawCircle and drawArc. The fullscreen canvas ctx carries a
 * DIFFERENT set: fillRect, print, setPixel, drawRect, `drawLine` (not `line`),
 * now() and random() — and no circle of any kind, no textWidth.
 *
 * The faces have to draw identically on both, so everything is normalized onto
 * fillRect here, which both do have. That is also how frameCtx implements its
 * own circle, so a shape drawn through this shim is pixel-consistent with a
 * built-in one rather than merely similar.

 * decides from the key it was handed:
 *
 *   face   the head, cropped to the head — a READOUT of WHO you are. It is
 *          declared access:"read", so the cell also wears the dotted stroke and
 *          cannot be mistaken for something turnable.
 *   vowel  the SAME character, cropped tight to the mouth region, so the
 *          aperture is large enough that turning the knob visibly moves it. A
 *          whole face in a 17x15 box moves by about one pixel; the mouth alone
 *          moves by five.
 *
 * `face` is read as a SIBLING KEY off the page's value map. That is the whole
 * reason the contract pins `face` to the same page as `vowel`: there is no
 * getParam here, so a widget can only learn the character from a key that
 * happens to be on the page beside it.
