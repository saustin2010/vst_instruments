/*
 * MonkSynth for Schwung — plugin_api_v2 adapter around the vendored FOF
 * vocal engine.
 *
 * The engine in dsp/{synth,voice,delay}.{c,h} is VENDORED VERBATIM from
 * charlesvestal/monksynth-ios, which in turn vendors it from
 * JonET/monksynth. It is pure C with no platform dependencies and is
 * READ-ONLY here: fix DSP bugs upstream and re-pull with
 * scripts/sync_dsp.sh. Everything Schwung-specific lives in this file.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE OWES THE HOST
 *
 *   Every entry point below runs ON THE SPI CALLBACK — create_instance,
 *   destroy_instance, set_param, get_param, on_midi and render_block alike.
 *   So: no logging, no file I/O, no locks, and no allocation anywhere except
 *   create_instance, where it is unavoidable.
 *
 *   create_instance is the expensive one and it is measured, not guessed:
 *   monk_synth_new mallocs 2.58 MB (ten MonkVoice at 168 KB each) and fills
 *   each voice's sine / formant-spline / cos-window / exp-decay tables, which
 *   costs ~0.8 ms on an Apple Silicon host. That is a few SPI frames' worth on
 *   the A72 — a brief click when the module is loaded into a slot, and nothing
 *   after. Steady-state render_block measures 4.3 us/block mono and 31.5 us at
 *   unison 9 on the same host, i.e. low single-digit percent of the ~2370 us
 *   frame budget. The load cost is inherent to the vendored engine's fixed
 *   ten-voice array; it is not something this adapter can defer without
 *   editing DSP we do not own.
 *
 * PARAMETERS are normalized 0..1 on the wire, exactly as upstream stores
 * them, and are converted to engine units here — the same conversions
 * AU/RenderContext.swift:89-113 performs, kept identical so a patch means the
 * same thing in both ports.
 *
 * CHARACTERS ARE PRESETS, NOT AN ENUM. The twelve characters are served
 * through the fleet's list_param / count_param / name_param contract, so the
 * shadow UI gives them its own auditioning browser page rather than a knob
 * with twelve dead detents. Selecting one applies that character's voice AND
 * sets `face`, which is what the JS surfaces draw.

 * WHICH PARAMS ARE SLEWED, AND WHY THEY HAVE TO BE.
 *
 * The vendored engine ramps exactly two things: pitch and vowel, over its
 * RAMP_TICKS = 10 ticks of 10 ms (the original Delay Lama's ramp). Everything
 * else ASSIGNS -- monk_voice_set_voice and monk_voice_set_aspiration are a
 * clamp and a store. So every knob detent was a hard discontinuity in a value
 * the grain is rebuilt from, which is audible as stair-stepping, and it gets
 * worse the faster you turn.
 *
 * Slewing here rather than upstream: dsp/ is vendored read-only, and this is a
 * host-integration concern anyway -- a VST host sends automation at audio rate,
 * while Move sends one discrete step per detent. Applied once per BLOCK
 * (2.9 ms at 128 frames), which is well inside the ~30 ms the ear reads as
 * immediate and far cheaper than per-sample.
 *
 * NOT slewed, deliberately:
 *   unison        an integer VOICE COUNT -- slewing it thrashes allocation
 *   glide, A/D/R  time constants, not signals; they are read when a stage
 *                 begins, so a slewed value is just a lagged setting
 * `sustain` IS slewed: it scales the envelope continuously, so a jump in it is
 * a jump in level.
